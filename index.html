                 The "src" attribute contains a URL pointing to the image you want to embed in the page. 
                 The "alt" attribute contains a textual description of the image, for use in situations where the image cannot be seen/displayed or takes a long time to render.
                 We can also use the "height" and the "widht" attribute to adjust the dimensions of the image (but these both are  optional atttributes)   -->
